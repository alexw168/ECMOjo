Information & Overview

ECMOjo is a simulator and trainer for extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO). It consists of a graphical user interface to allow
interaction and train ECMO practitioners, and has been developed by Telehealth
Research Institute (TRI), University of Hawaii. ECMOjo contains
the word ECMO and mojo (magic charm). In intensive care medicine,
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an artificial device to provide
both cardiac and respiratory support oxygen to patients whose heart and lungs
are so severely diseased or damaged that they can no longer serve their
function.

ECMOjo is open source software hosted on SourceForge and GitHub. The
program has been implemented in Java and can be run as either a standalone
desktop application or via the Internet. ECMOjo has been developed by
Telehealth Research Institute, University of Hawaii.
